[h1]Detailed gameplay description[/h1]
[h2]Basic Mechanics[/h2]
To begin surveying planets in the system, you must order a science ship with a scientist to orbit any star in the system. Once the science ship enters orbit, an "Advanced survey" project of the appropriate level will appear near each planet available for exploration.

Order the science ships to explore these projects. When these projects are completed, there is a chance of an anomaly, additional resource or scientific deposits or archaeological sites. For habitable planets, there is a small chance of a new district appearing.

There are 25 levels of "Advanced survey" planet projects available. Accordingly, each planet can be explored 25 times + 1 survey from the vanilla game. After each "Advanced survey" project is completed, the next project on the same planet will be 1 level higher.

Each level of "Advanced survey" project requires a corresponding level of "Advanced planet survey" technology (see Technology section).

Each new level of the "Advanced survey" project takes more and more days to complete. See table: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uGbTwHa0kYYPEEUmYl1fRNXAhlMDTnGO8RHQL6ilM8E/gid=0 .

[h2]Automatic survey[/h2]
When a science ship orbits a star and creates " Advanced Survey" projects, the science ship is automatically ordered to explore the nearest project. After completing any "Advanced Survey" project, the science ship continues to search for nearby new projects. If the science ship has not found any "Advanced Survey" projects, the projects are automatically created if possible.

This is done so that the player does not have to do a lot of routine creating projects and giving orders for each project. 

To disable automatic research on projects, go to the "Government" -> "Policies and Edicts" menu and activate the "Disable automatic Advanced Research" edict.

[h2]Technologies[/h2]
There are 5 technologies available in the game, each depending on the previous one. Technologies begin to appear starting from the 4th technology tier. Each learned technology opens the possibility to start the next 5 levels of [b]Advanced Survey[/b] projects. For example, if you learn 5 levels of [b]Advanced Exploration[/b] technologies, you will be able to survey each planet 25 times.

All [b]Advanced survey[/b] technologies belong to the Physical Survey branch.

A list of all technologies in this mod is provided in [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uGbTwHa0kYYPEEUmYl1fRNXAhlMDTnGO8RHQL6ilM8E/edit#gid=1314599674]table[/url].

[h2]Discovering deposits on a planet[/h2]
Approximate chance of a resource or science deposit appearing on a planet after completing the "Advanced survey" project:
[LIST]
[*] with minerals, energy, trade value: 5%;
[*] with physical, social, engineering research: 5%;
[*] with dark matter, sprues, zro: 1.5%;
[*] with rare crystals, explosive dust, exotic gases: 1%;
[*] with minor artifacts: 0.5% (only if there is an archaeological site on the planet).
[/LIST]

Keep in mind that only those deposits can appear on planets for which there is a non-zero chance in vanilla planetary exploration. For example, you'll only find dark matter in black holes.

With each successive level of "Advanced survey" project, the chance of finding deposits increases by about 0.25%. At level 25, the chance is about 6.25% higher than at level 1. 

Having the veteran class "Explorer" increases the chance of all resources appearing by 5%.

If a new deposit was found, its size will always be +1. For optimization purposes, the mod tries not to clutter the game with multiple resource deposits, but rather converts two identical small resource deposits into a single large one whenever possible. If possible, it converts two small resource deposits into one large one.

If a new deposit was opened on a planet that has an "Habitat", the resources from that deposit become available to the "Habitat".

If a planet has a resource deposit, the chance of a new resource deposit will increase by 5%, while the chance of a science deposit will be 0.
Similarly, if a planet has a science deposit, the chance of a new science deposit will increase by 10% and the chance of a resource deposit will be 0.
This is done because you cannot mix resource and science deposits on the same planet. A deposit with a trade value can be mixed with any other deposit.

In this table (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uGbTwHa0kYYPEEUmYl1fRNXAhlMDTnGO8RHQL6ilM8E/#gid=1572462715), I tried to roughly calculate the chance of opening different resource deposits on different planets and stars in a vanilla game. In this mod, I've tried to build off of those numbers and the same requirements for the planets on which the corresponding resources can appear.

[h2]Experience for completing projects[/h2]
Leaders receive experience for completing projects, which depends on the level of the planet's "Advanced survey" project.

The amount of experience received for each project level is described in the table: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uGbTwHa0kYYPEEUmYl1fRNXAhlMDTnGO8RHQL6ilM8E/

In order to ensure that low-level leaders are not instantly pumped up, there is a penalty on the experience they receive when completing high-level projects.
A leader cannot gain more than 5% of the experience required until the next level of that leader. For example, a level 2 leader cannot gain more than 55 units of experience.
Limitations in the experience gained are described in the table: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uGbTwHa0kYYPEEUmYl1fRNXAhlMDTnGO8RHQL6ilM8E/#gid=1977577132 .

Country modifiers on the amount of experience leaders receive are applied after the experience penalty described above.

[h2]Discovering Anomalies[/h2]
When completing the "Advanced survey" project:
[LIST]
[*] Anomalies will not appear in the starting star system.
[*] Base chance of an anomaly appearing = 3%. 
[*] Which anomaly will appear is chosen randomly and with the same weights as specified in the vanilla game.
[*] Unlike in the vanilla game, the chance of an anomaly appearing does not increase with each failed attempt of a science ship. 
[*] Any vanilla repeatable anomalies may appear. Anomalies with the flag "unique to country" and with the flag "unique to galaxy" will not appear.
[*] The Explorer scientist class gives a +10% chance of an anomaly appearing (there is no such modifier in the vanilla game).
[*] Anomalies added by other mods will not appear until patches are made for it.
[*] As long as there is an anomaly on a planet, no new [b]Advanced Survey[/b] projects will be created on that planet. This is to avoid errors.
[*] As long as there is an anomaly on a planet, existing resource and science deposits will not be visible on that planet.
[/LIST]

The chance of an anomaly appearing after completing the "Extended survey" project is affected by the following modifiers that affect the chance of anomalies appearing in vanilla planetary survey.

When an anomaly appears, a notification similar to the vanilla one appears, but clicking on this notification opens the planet window instead of the anomaly. This was done due to limitations for game modification.

After some anomalies are completed, events may occur that generate resources or science on the planet. When this happens, old deposits are removed from the planet. Note that this happens after you have selected the appropriate option in the dialog box that appears after completing an anomaly study. Unfortunately, it is not possible to capture events with dialog boxes that appear after an anomaly. But there is another solution: as soon as a science ship finishes exploring an anomaly, several timers are started after 3, 30, 90 days, which activate the check of such planets by this Mod. If during these checks the mod finds that deposits have been deleted, the mod tries to restore them. If for some reason the check failed and the deposits are not restored, order a science ship with a scientist to orbit a star, then all planets in the solar system will be rechecked.

Also keep in mind that science deposits, resource deposits, and deposits with trade value are incompatible. Anomalies can add an incompatible deposit to existing deposits on a planet and this will cause a bug with the deposit display on the planet. I will try to fix this issue in the future.

[h2]Discovering Archaeological sites[/h2]
When completing the "Advanced survey" project:
[LIST]
[*] Base chance of site appearing is 0.1% (in vanilla game chance = 1.25%)
[*] Random sites from vanilla game and from any mods may appear.
[*] The same modifiers that affect the rate of research archaeological sites in the vanilla game affect the chance of site appearing.
[*] The Explorer scientist class gives a +10% chance of site appearing (there is no such modifier in the vanilla game).
[/LIST]

[h2]Discovering deposits on habitable planets[/h2]
After completing the "Advanced survey" project, inhabited planets may have one of the resource deposits, which adds a mineral, energy, or farming district. Similarly, a strategic resource deposit may appear, adding strategic resource mining jobs.

The chance of any planetary resource deposit appearing = 1%.

Every 4 open deposits on a planet increases the maximum number of districts by +1.

[h2]Orbital Settlements[/h2]
In the vanilla game, if you build a [b]Orbital Station[/b] in the orbit of a planet, minerals, energy credits and science on that planet stop being mined (mining and science stations disappear). Instead, the [b]Habitat Central Complex[/b] expands the limit of relevant districts. This logic doesn't change depending on the size of deposits (and those deposits can get large because of this mod) and it can be a bit frustrating.
To compensate for this, the mod adds new resource deposits to orbital settlements that replace the disabled orbital deposits on planets and passively give income with the corresponding resources (even small artifacts). It's essentially a buff to [b]Habitats[/b], but in the late game it's not that big of a deal.

In the vanilla game, if you build a [b]Orbital Station[/b] in orbit of a planet that has resources such as [b]alloys[/b], [b]exotic gases[/b], [b]flying dust[/b], [b]rare crystals[/b], [b]dark matter[/b], [b]zro[/b], then their corresponding deposits are added to the [b]Habitat Central Complex[/b]. But there is a problem that if there are identical deposits of the same type on the same planet (can be added because of this mod), then some of the deposits do not appear in the [b]Habitat Central Complex[/b]. The mod fixes this problem (although the mod itself created this problem, haha).

If a [b]Orbital Station[/b] has already been built on the planet, and if new deposits have been discovered as a result of [b]Advanced Exploration[/b], the mod adds these deposits to the [b]Habitat Central Complex[/b]. Scientific and mining districts are added in the same way. Sometimes this results in a normal [b]Orbital Station[/b] being rebuilt into a mining/science [b]Orbital Station[/b].

[h2]Loss of star systems with projects[/h2]
If a system has been lost (an outpost disassembled, occupied, or taken away), the current "Advanced survey" projects of planets in that system are canceled. The occupier or old owner or new owner of the system can then resume the projects.

[h2]Project Research Speed[/h2]
In the vanilla game, the number of days spent on special projects is fixed and cannot be changed with any modifiers.
In order to get around this limitation, the mod counts the modifiers, compares this to the duration of "Advanced survey" projects and cancels the projects early, even though the projects are considered complete to the mod. This makes the traits of scientists, technology, speed pointers, and other modifiers for planetary exploration useful relative to "Advanced survey" projects even in late game. In addition to this, you won't be bothered by frequent sound notifications of project completion (and there will be a lot of "Advanced survey" projects).

The "Advanced survey" project study rate is how many days of a project are researched in one day of game time. It can be increased with vanilla technology, edicts, scientist traits, and scientist level (all things that affect vanilla planet exploration speed).
Formula: 
[code]days = base_special_project_days / (1 + modifier + modifier + modifier + modifier...)[/code].
Each scientist level adds +10% to the project exploration speed.

Upon completion of the project, the science ship receives a 20-day boost to sublight  speed equal to the total exploration speed modifier of planets. For example, if you have a +40% planetary exploration speed, then at the end of the project, the science ship will receive an additional +40% to its sublight  speed for 20 days.

The number of days of the project also has a margin of error of -10 days, i.e. the project can end earlier by a random number of days, but no more than 10 days. It does not depend on any modifiers.

The basic number of days required to complete different levels of "Advanced survey" projects can be seen in the table: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uGbTwHa0kYYPEEUmYl1fRNXAhlMDTnGO8RHQL6ilM8E/ .
